    "The Bokeh server is a component of the Bokeh library that allows you to create interactive web applications with real-time updates using Python. It enables you to build dynamic and interactive data visualizations that can respond to user interactions or external data changes without requiring a complete page reload.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the Bokeh server, you can create plots that update in real-time based on user inputs, such as sliders, buttons, or dropdowns. You can also connect your plots to live data streams or databases, and as new data arrives, the plots can be automatically updated on the client side.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a basic overview of how you can use the Bokeh server to create interactive plots that update in real-time:\n",
    "\n",
    "Import Dependencies:\n",

    "Create Data and Interactive Elements:\n",

    "Create your data and any interactive elements you want to use in your application, like sliders, buttons, or text inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Define Callback Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Define callback functions that will be executed when user interactions or data changes occur. These functions will update the data and properties of your plot accordingly.\n",

    "Create the Plot and Layout:\n",
    "\n",
    "Create your plot using the figure function and arrange it along with the interactive elements in a layout, such as a column or row.\n",
    "\n",
    "Add Callbacks to Elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "Attach the callback functions you defined earlier to the interactive elements. This tells Bokeh what actions should trigger updates to the plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the Bokeh Server:\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the Bokeh server, use the bokeh serve command in your terminal, followed by the name of the Python script containing your application code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simplified example of how you might use the Bokeh server to create an interactive plot with a slider that updates the plot data in real-time\n",
